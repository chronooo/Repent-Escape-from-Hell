;   in this array, each entry with bits %76543210:

;   bits 43210 represent the character that is displayed in the custom character set.
;   Since our character set starts at 0x1C00 and screen memory begins at 0x1E00, we have 
;   32 characters to choose from. bits 43210 represent a number x from 0 to 31 such that
;   %76543210 will display character at address 0x1c00 + 16x.

;   We have bits 7, 6, 5 to store potential additional information if we need in a number from 0 to 7.
;   possible additional information to store: projectile movement timer, enemy attack timer, enemy movement timer,
;   tough enemy's health points, etc...
