# 599.82 Retro Game

Instructions: 
cd into the main_game folder, and type make to compile the game. 

Background: 
You (the main character), are a devout believer that has met an early and unfortunate death. You open your eyes and realize that you are now in the afterlife, but to your surprise you've ended up in Hell. You pray to your Lord, questioning why you've been placed in this position, and to your response he replies, telling you that theres been a mistake. He tells you that you belong in Heaven, and offers you a weapon telling you to escape from Hell and make your way to the pearly gates. With your path determined, you begin your journey.

Controls: 
As youd expect, the game uses standard WASD for movement. 

The J key is for shooting the weapon. The weapon is used to defeat the monsters, each monster takes 1 bullet to defeat.

The R key is to restart the game

Gameplay: 
The goal of the game is to reach the end of the stage, which at the end youll find a door leading to salvation. 

One of the immediate things that youll notice is that you cannot jump, to move around vertically the player must utilize ladders and gravity. Youll notice that you can cover quite a bit of horizontal space when falling from a height, use this to your advantage. 

There are a couple of unique buttons and levers that youll encounter in the map, I'll leave their features a surprise to you, but to interact with them you simply need to walk over them and press the down (S). 

We also have a health system, run out of health and the game restarts. There are two ways to lose health. The most obvious way is to get hit by a monster. The second way is to fall into a pit. Youll find that occasionally there will be a large hole on the floor, fall into one of these and youll lose health. Since the player cannot jump there is no way for the player to escape the hole themselves, so the player will respawn in a safe space on the left side of the screen.

Since you can lose health, that also means that you should be able to gain health, right? 
~~wrong!~~ Just kidding, as you explore the stage you'll occasionally run into a heart shaped container, run over it  and press down (S) to pick it up to regain 1 health per heart.
